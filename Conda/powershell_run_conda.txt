Here is my easier solution which works with Anaconda, Miniconda, and even Miniforge:

1. Open PowerShell and browse to condabin folder in your Conda installation directory, for example: C:\Users\<username>\anaconda3\condabin
2. Run ./conda init powershell in that folder, and reopen the PowerShell.
3. Please note: If you encountered ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system, simply run the PowerShell as Administrator and enter the following: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
4. Restart the PowerShell and enjoy!
